You just explained how to be a commie. Be better",0.7774984,high
1,"Ridicule, calling people stupid, ""dunking on them"", etc. is less likely to make them change their mind and take your side than it is more likely to make them feel attacked, get defensive and double down on their current views.",0.77023625,high
2,Q is the biggest troll of the century. Somewhere he/she/it? Is lolling tf out,0.56276566,high
3,By labeling everything on the right as far right conspiracies you are discrediting any criticism of the left. Sending links of anything that disproves leftist beliefs is met with hysteria. Stop circle jerking  yourselves with your evidence seeking talk when you cherry pick only what fits your narratives. Why don't you admit when you are wrong?,0.54405195,high

7,"If you actually read Qanon posts for yourself, you'll realize that he's only pointing out to people to look at a certain direction and at doors that have been opened. He does not force people to walk through those doors but rather to think for themselves and not simply trusting MSM and the likes (like NYT ðŸ¤ª). The ""horde"" of Qanon followers is simply the result of people doing their own thinking and soul searching and reaching their own conclusions (of which they are entitled too under the 1st Amendment). I'm grabbing my popcorn as I watch how MSM and big tech are digging their own grave and running scared about the explosion of truth that is about to come.

Whether Qanon is an agent provocateur or a patriot, he has the effect of getting people to think for themselves and not simply trust in what they've be told by the system like lemmings. The rest are still under the ""mind-control"" (for lack of a better word), of their own institutionalized conformity.

Apparently, a world ruled by satan-worshipping pedophile cannibals is too hard to believe, but time-travel, a flat-universe that originated from an explosion, steel skyscrapers falling at free-fall acceleration due to fires, and going to the moon with 60s technology isn't.",0.31521702,medium

Also Trumpists: ""EVERYTHING THIS COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS PERSON IS SAYING IS TRUE!""",0.31089434,medium
9,"Fun Fact: The whole ""Wayfair selling children as cabinets"" thing started on reddit when someone was complaining about their cabinet prices. Qanons trolls came in with the explanation that it was that it was a front for selling childrens. However real reason they were listed so expensive ($10,000 - $13,000) was to restock the products so that no one would buy them until they had more without taking the listing down.",0.26159194,medium

11,This is a really really good video. We're all human and we have to show empathy; mocking or getting aggressive just divides us even more.,0.18435931,medium
12,"What's required in my view is educating people on the scientific method and focus on helping them develop a basic understanding of logical fallacies and critical thinking. I love the idea of asking questions too, turn their intellect on as opposed to off.",0.15545595,medium
13,The fact that this country began because others were persecuted for their beliefs seems to be lost to everyone.,0.149239,medium
14,"If you must censor or silence your opponent you aren't ""debunking"" anything.Â You're merely pointing out that you fear what they might say.",0.14573883,medium
