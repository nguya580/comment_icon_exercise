People living in fear.\\n\\nBeing from NYC it was urban legend that all pizza parlors were owned and run by the mafia. When a character like Alex Jones says a child sex ring is being run out of a pizzeria, wht was he implying? Then the Epstein/Maxwell story broke. They did it all on their own? Were they the Lizard People From the Fifth Dimension Alex Jones connected to the pizzeria? \\n\\nThere are busts every year in Houston of pedophiles. Nearly every law enforcement organization is involved from the Houston police to the Dept of Homeland Security. It is described as a hub for sex trafficking. What exactly does that mean? The news tells us about the arrest but we are never the whole picture. How many hubs exist? Who is involved? Why do we have to go to alternate media to find remnants of the truth?\\n\\nInternational Pedophile rings don't  exist do they? And the rich would never do nothing so disgusting? You'd have to be a paranoid fool to believe such things. Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton? Only haters would say anything bad about them.\\n\\nThe nytimes usually doesn't print post  like this.

       "    'commentBody': 'QAnon\\'s narrative of Deep State and New World Order is just a refreshed clone of an early antisemitic propaganda lore called \"The Protocols of the Elder from Zion\" created by the Ochrana, the secret service of the Russian czar Nikolaus II. at the dawn of the 20th century, which was originally intended to link jewish intellectuals with freemasonry. The nazis, especially their main hoax generator Julius Streicher with his arch-antisemite magazine \"Der Stürmer\" (comparable to today\\'s Breitbart News), later added the age-old medieval story of  a jewish conspiracy to kidnap christian babies, ritually sacrifice them and drink their fresh blood in order to achieve longevity (there you go with Hillary\\'s pizza parlor). \\nThese \\'protocols\\' were first published in 1903, and their main purpose was to discredit jews and freemasons who the czar believed to be his opponents (a few years later the Bolshevists overthrew his regime and murdered his family).\\nThey pointed out that there was an international financial elite which tries to dominate the whole world (as a first concept of globalization).\\n\\nSo you may easily see that this is actually old stuff warmed up in our present days. Nothing new, but scary enough when  believed by thugs who are armed to their teeth and feel deep inside that they are losers in history.',\n",

When a character like Alex Jones says a child sex ring is being run out of a pizzeria, wht was he implying? Then the Epstein/Maxwell story broke. They did it all on their own? Were they the Lizard People From the Fifth Dimension Alex Jones connected to the pizzeria? \\n\\nThere are busts every year in Houston of pedophiles. Nearly every law enforcement organization is involved from the Houston police to the Dept of Homeland Security. It is described as a hub for sex trafficking. What exactly does that mean? The news tells us about the arrest but we are never the whole picture. How many hubs exist? Who is involved? Why do we have to go to alternate media to find remnants of the truth?\\n\\nInternational Pedophile rings don't  exist do they? And the rich would never do nothing so disgusting? You'd have to be a paranoid fool to believe such things. Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton? Only haters would say anything bad about them.\\n\\nThe nytimes usually doesn't print post  like this. It' was fun trying though.\", 'Noam Chomsky? That one photo colors your entire report as sloppy.', 'Maybe \"Q\" is actually a Russian disinformation campaign.', \"I guess the German's fell for the line that Jews were eating babies, and the economic metrics are similar, a lot of desperate poor people and a few rich people controlling all the money. So Donald gets it into his head from one of his sociopathic advisors that he should stick with QAnon. It has legs! \\n\\nI don't think so. We're not 1933 Germans. We're a bunch of diverse people who will withstand the defilement of our country. We will accept our responsibilities to the world that we have not always been kind to.

The nazis, especially their main hoax generator Julius Streicher with his arch-antisemite magazine \"Der Stürmer\" (comparable to today\\'s Breitbart News), later added the age-old medieval story of  a jewish conspiracy to kidnap christian babies, ritually sacrifice them and drink their fresh blood in order to achieve longevity (there you go with Hillary\\'s pizza parlor). \\nThese \\'protocols\\' were first published in 1903, and their main purpose was to discredit jews and freemasons who the czar believed to be his opponents (a few years later the Bolshevists overthrew his regime and murdered his family).\\nThey pointed out that there was an international financial elite which tries to dominate the whole world (as a first concept of globalization).\\n\\nSo you may easily see that this is actually old stuff warmed up in our present days.

The nazis, especially their main hoax generator Julius Streicher with his arch-antisemite magazine \"Der Stürmer\" (comparable to today's Breitbart News), later added the age-old medieval story of  a jewish conspiracy to kidnap christian babies, ritually sacrifice them and drink their fresh blood in order to achieve longevity (there you go with Hillary's pizza parlor). \\nThese 'protocols' were first published in 1903, and their main purpose was to discredit jews and freemasons who the czar believed to be his opponents (a few years later the Bolshevists overthrew his regime and murdered his family).\\nThey pointed out that there was an intern...   \n",
