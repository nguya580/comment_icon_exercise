What do we do about the significant number of Americans who have near zero critical thinking skills?  Take away their idiot drug (phones)?",0.9403218,high
1,"Sorry, but anyone who believes in Q is by definition stupid. Really stupid.",0.93232936,high
2,"Go for the jocular (not jugular) vein. Not sure who to attribute this to (Barney Frank?)

Or as Jefferson put it:
  ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions. ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them; ...

I just  double down on any QAnon-type  stupidity that happens in my presence. Eg Rush's idiotic Obama is a Islamo-fascist.",0.8785311,high

There are plenty of morons to go around.",0.8606264,high
4,Is this another sign of how stupid the American public has become?  Why are most stupid conspiracy theories always born on the right?,0.8606264,high
5,"Condemn them and it.
Ridicule them and it.
Shame them and it.
Then ignore them and it.

When all is said and done, it will probably turn out to be a Russian propaganda stunt to gin up the idiotic cultists to assist the juvenile delinquent in the White House",0.8530425,high
6,"I'm no Q supporter but what a waste of 10 minutes. Psycho gobbledygook. Never delves into what the Qanons say re: the pedo cult... it's just absurd... so, nothing there.  Pathetic!",0.8074953,high
7,"QAnon, Trump, McConnell, and Amy Coney Barrett. Let’s see hear...

An ancient alien race’s artifact is found by Fred Trump when fighting child brain-sucking Democrat communists in 1953. His son used the very powerful talisman to summon Amy Coney Barrett from McConnell’s horse farm in Kentucky to become the first High Priestess of the Supreme Court.

If you say it over and over, it almost makes sense. I’ll entertain streaming offers.

I’m humbled by the Old Testament prophecy of comedian Ron White... You just can’t fix stupid!",0.8060606,high
8,"I think it might be coded cover for anti-semetic, white power, sexist, homophobes united. Accepted deniability in absurdity. Cannibalism is code for blacks, pedophiles for gays, elites for Jews, liberals for feminists. A few followers take it literally at face value, but most probably share a tacit  understanding.",0.76868147,high
9,"Speaking in codes happens in countries losing grip on their ability to speak freely. People living in fear.

Being from NYC it was urban legend that all pizza parlors were owned and run by the mafia. When a character like Alex Jones says a child sex ring is being run out of a pizzeria, wht was he implying? Then the Epstein/Maxwell story broke. They did it all on their own? Were they the Lizard People From the Fifth Dimension Alex Jones connected to the pizzeria? 

There are busts every year in Houston of pedophiles. Nearly every law enforcement organization is involved from the Houston police to the Dept of Homeland Security. It is described as a hub for sex trafficking. What exactly does that mean? The news tells us about the arrest but we are never the whole picture. How many hubs exist? Who is involved? Why do we have to go to alternate media to find remnants of the truth?

International Pedophile rings don't  exist do they? And the rich would never do nothing so disgusting? You'd have to be a paranoid fool to believe such things. Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton? Only haters would say anything bad about them.

The nytimes usually doesn't print post  like this. It' was fun trying though.",0.5803554,high
10,"What do we do about Q?  We treat them as terrorists and subversives, because that's what they are.  
     
Q crazies are more dangerous than most terrorists, though, because their irrationality makes their actions unpredictable.  There's nothing more dangerous than a crazy with a gun.",0.5722081,high
11,"I guess the German's fell for the line that Jews were eating babies, and the economic metrics are similar, a lot of desperate poor people and a few rich people controlling all the money. So Donald gets it into his head from one of his sociopathic advisors that he should stick with QAnon. It has legs! 

I don't think so. We're not 1933 Germans. We're a bunch of diverse people who will withstand the defilement of our country. We will accept our responsibilities to the world that we have not always been kind to. We need to grow up.",0.53490317,high
12,"QAnon's narrative of Deep State and New World Order is just a refreshed clone of an early antisemitic propaganda lore called ""The Protocols of the Elder from Zion"" created by the Ochrana, the secret service of the Russian czar Nikolaus II. at the dawn of the 20th century, which was originally intended to link jewish intellectuals with freemasonry. The nazis, especially their main hoax generator Julius Streicher with his arch-antisemite magazine ""Der Stürmer"" (comparable to today's Breitbart News), later added the age-old medieval story of  a jewish conspiracy to kidnap christian babies, ritually sacrifice them and drink their fresh blood in order to achieve longevity (there you go with Hillary's pizza parlor). 
These 'protocols' were first published in 1903, and their main purpose was to discredit jews and freemasons who the czar believed to be his opponents (a few years later the Bolshevists overthrew his regime and murdered his family).
They pointed out that there was an international financial elite which tries to dominate the whole world (as a first concept of globalization).

So you may easily see that this is actually old stuff warmed up in our present days. Nothing new, but scary enough when  believed by thugs who are armed to their teeth and feel deep inside that they are losers in history.",0.5077852,high

14,"Missing here is why the seventeen of so US investigative agencies and/or an assortment of online hacker-tracker geniuses have not already sourced and outed principle QAnon activists with a view toward suppression or eradication of the malignant mental virus?

Perhaps QAnon serves some purpose of higher-pay-grade conspirators such that the rumor mills are allowed - enabled, encouraged, subsidized - to keep spewing forth this psychic filth to the amusement and advantage of those controlling the levers of psycho-political power…",0.44766575,medium
15,The ones well down the rabbit hole are hard to reach. To stop the curious from following it’s necessary to make fun of it and state clearly the outlandish parts otherwise they cont8nue thinking it’s all normal. Don’t just listen to their tales of save the children ask th3m if they really believe in cannibal pedophiles. Make them confront how bizarre it is. Don’t give it legitimacy.,0.44082078,medium
16,I give up. I’ve lost a life time best friend over this nonsense. He was best man at my wedding and vice versa. We can’t even discuss anything without him raising Q theories. I try to change the subject but things keep heading into the rabbit hole. I give up.,0.42890763,medium
17,"This is as dangerous as Naziism. I fully point the finger at Putin as he well knows exactly the most effective way to snuff the enlightenment flame we’ve miraculously kept alight these two and a half centuries.  With truth made either relative or inscrutable by information bubbles, we have begun to slip down the slope.

20,"Don't know what to do about cultists, but everyone else should be aware that Q is essentially a modernized version of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a conspiracy theory that swept the world 120 years ago and led to pogroms, world wars, European fascism and the Holocaust.

How about sensationalist oriented cable networks like MSNBC stop promoting it by running stories that start out this way:

BREAKING NEWS!
